# PHP-Practice
My php journey. This repo showcases my knowledge of PHP
I have used XMAPP apache servers to run these php scripts. I did some tinkering to create custom aliases aswell.
More to come. I wanted to be up to speed with some PHP for my summer internship. :)

 Basic : contains basic php implementations.
Database: Contains php code that uses databases. The database was preset on my local machine and requires MYsql to be running.
